# More information about Tom

Tom is a senior developer and coach at Ordina Belgium.
Some friends like to refer to him as a Java code monkey, which is not completely true!
Tom is familiar with many different domains. 
He loves to learn about everything.
Currently he is very fond of Docker, Go and all things DevOps.

In his spare time he likes spending time with friends, going out for a run with his marathon club or 
just swinging around some drum sticks.
